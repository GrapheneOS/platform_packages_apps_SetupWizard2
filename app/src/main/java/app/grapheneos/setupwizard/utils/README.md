# Guidelines

- ideally we don't want anything here, unless if completely unavoidable.
- utils are actually an anti-pattern. they slowly become an unmanageable dumping ground for things
  which require more effort to fit into a proper OOPS design. utils actually tend to produce
  procedural style code (instead of OOPS style), which make our life simpler, but only temporarily.
